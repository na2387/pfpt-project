This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## To Do

[ ] Dropdown borough search
[ ] Click out of insurance badges in search
[ ] Expand to see all insurances in results (pop-up on mouse over of "+x more"?)
[ ] Sort by column
[ ] Faster provider load speeds
[ ] Ensure rate columns are accurate to intent
[ ] Better pagination (first page, last page, etc.)
